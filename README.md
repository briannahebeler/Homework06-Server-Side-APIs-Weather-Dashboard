# Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this project my goal was to build a Weather Dashboard featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Through the utilization of the OpenWeather API this application is able to retrieve the current forecast, the current UV index, and the 5 day projected forecast for as many cities they search. 
When the user is looking at the current forecast they will see the city name, date, an icon representing the current weather condition, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index. 
The UV index is color coded to depict the UV conditions. If the UV is green the conditions are favorable. If it is orange they are moderate, and if red they are severe. 
Using the users local storage, the sessions city search history will be displayed on the side left side of the dashboard. The user can click on any of their previous city searches and the weather data will display on the dashboard. On page reload, the user will have the last displayed city load on the dashboard. 



User is able to:
- to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
Is able to search for a city & will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
